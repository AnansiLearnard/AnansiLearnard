### Hi there, I'm Anansi ðŸ‘‹


Hey there! I'm Anansi, an ODU student who is currently persuing a degree in Game Design. I like to make art, I like to write, and most importantly I love to make videogames! My dream career is to be a character and environment concept artist in the videogame industry. Nothing more besides that, other than I love playing videogames as much as I like making them. Some of my favorites are the Pokemon, Shin Megami Tensei, Persona, and Zelda franchises.
